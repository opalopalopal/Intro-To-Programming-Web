        </ul>


        <li>Talking</li>
        <ul>

            <li>Your opinions are always correct and you know this</li>
            <li>Singing along with your music is also allowed</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
    <h3>Why Social Interaction Will <em>KILL</em> You</h3>

    <ul>People might disagree with your opinions despite them being correct</ul>
    <ul>You might accidentally spit while speaking which everyone will remember for the rest of your life</ul>
